# KnightHacks2023

## Getting Started

1. clone this repo to your vscode
2. do  npm i in your terminal
3. to run the .js files,  do node "file-name"

### What's each file for?

1. pdf.js
```bash
 This .js file turns the **lottowinners_floridalotto.pdf** to raw data and then to some regex stuff to make it prettier.

 The result is updated in the **pdfoutput.txt** folder.

 Every time you do *node pdf.js* in you terminal, **pdfoutput.txt** will be updated.
```
